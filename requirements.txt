# Core Libraries (Direct Imports)
opencv-python<4.12      # Use <4.12 to stay compatible with MediaPipe's numpy requirement
numpy>=1.26.4,<2        # Keep numpy 1.26.x (must be <2) to satisfy mediapipe
gTTS>=2.5.4            # For Google Text-to-Speech generation
pygame>=2.0.1          # For playing audio alerts from gTTS
mediapipe>=0.10.21     # For FaceMesh and Hands detection
scipy>=1.15.3          # For spatial distance calculations

# UI Framework (PyQt6 for the Animated Loading Screen)
PyQt6>=6.0.0

# Critical Dependencies (Often required by MediaPipe/OpenCV)
protobuf>=4.25.8
# Note: playsound and dlib were not present in `pip freeze` output when this file
# was generated earlier. If you need them and they fail to import locally, you can
# try installing `playsound` via pip (pip install playsound) and for `dlib`
# use a prebuilt wheel matching your Python & OS or build from source.
